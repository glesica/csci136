# Introduction

The course catalog describes this course thusly:

> Survey of computer science topics including recursion, algorithms, basic
> data structures, operating systems, artificial intelligence, graphics,
> user interfaces, and social and ethical implications of computing.

In general, we'll be focused on becoming better programmers. We will learn some
new techniques that will help us build larger, better organized programs. We
will also introduce some classic problems in computer science like searching
and sorting.

# Policies

Please read this section carefully so that there are no surprises.

## Late Assignments

I do not accept late assignments under any circumstance except as required by
university policy. You will have more than enough time to complete each
assignment, so even if you have other commitments or emergencies you should
still be able to complete all of the assignments.

**Do not wait until just before the deadline to submit assignments.**

## Makeup Exams

I do not administer makeup exams under any circumstance except as required by
university policy. If you must miss an exam due to a conflict related to an
intercollegiate sport, medical procedure, or personal emergency, you must
notify me as soon as you find out about the conflict.

If you fail to notify me until after the exam has been administered you will
not be allowed to make it up.

## Attendance

I do not take attendance, but students who skip class regularly are extremely
unlikely to do well in this course. If you plan to miss lectures often you
should speak with me as soon as possible so that we can discuss your situation
and decide whether you should drop the class.

## Extra Credit

I may assign extra credit during the semester, or I may not. Do not count on
there being opportunities for extra credit.

# Schedule

A tentative course schedule is below. This should be considered very tentative.
It is very likely that we will deviate from this schedule in one way or another
based on how quickly we move through the material and how well it seems the
class is keeping up.

If, at any point, you feel that the course is moving too quickly or too slowly,
please let me know.

# Textbook

Java Software Solutions 8th edition -- Lewis and Loftus

You **must** have the correct edition of the textbook or the assignments will
not make sense. Note that the 8th "international" edition will not work.

# Homework

During the semester there will generally be one homework assignment per week.
These assignments usually do not involve writing significant code, but they
will often involve writing pseudo code.

These assignments should be completed individually. If you work with other
students on them, be sure that you understand the answers because many of the
exam questions will be inspired by the homework assignments.

Homework assignments will be submitted through Moodle.

# Labs

There will be approximately one lab assignment per week. Labs will involve
writing and running code.

You are free to work with a partner, but you must each turn in all of the
assigned problems and you should not copy-paste solutions, you must implement
your own programs.

Lab assignments will be submitted through Moodle.

# Exams

There will be four exams plus a cumulative final exam. Some exams will be
significantly shorter than others.

For the longer exams, we will have a review on the preceding Monday (if the
class wants to do so) and the exam on the following Wednesday. I haven't
budgeted any review time for the shorter exams, but since they won't take the
entire 50 minutes, I can answer questions before we start.

# Grading

The grading scale is as follows: 100--90: A, 89--80: B, 79--70: C, 69--60: D,
below 60: F. I do not round grades.

Homework, labs, and exams each count for one third of your course grade. I will
drop your lowest exam grade. I will also drop all but your best eight homework
assignments and all but your best eight lab assignments. Note, however, that
I make no promises as to how many assignments we will have in total.

**Do not count on extra credit or a particular number of assignments.**

# Disabilities

This course is accessible to and usable by otherwise qualified students with
disabilities. To request reasonable program modifications, please consult with
the instructor. Disability Services for Students will assist the instructor and
student in the modification process. For more information, visit the Disability
Services website at <http://life.umt.edu/dss/>.
